--- Type inference ---

Type inference in Typescript refers to the ability of the 
Typescript compiler to automatically determine and assign types to 
variable, expressions, and function return values based on their usage and context in the code.

-todo what are some best practices for using type inference in Typescript?

=> Use type inference for simple cases where the assigned 
value clearly indicates the intended type.

=> When in doubt, provide explicit type annotation to make 
your intentions clear.

=> avoid replying too heavily on type inference when the assigned value 
is complex or ambiguous.

=> Regularly review and refactor your code to ensure that  inferred types
align with your intentons.




---- ---- Optional and Default Parameter ---- ----

Typescript allows you to define optional and Default practices in functions. 
optional Parameter are denoted by appending a ? symbol after the Parameter name,
and Default Parameter are specified by providing a Default value in the Parameter
