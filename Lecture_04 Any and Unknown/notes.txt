<<---- Any Type ---->>

=> The any type is the most flexible type in Typescript. it essentailly
turn off all type checking for the varible or expression it is applied to.

UseCase-->

working with dynamic data : when dealing with data from dynamic soures
like user input, network responses, or deserialized JSON Object, 
working with APIs than "Any" type can be useful.


<<---- Unknown Type ---->>

=> The Unknown type is a safer alternative to 'any' because it still
enforces type checking and type safety.

varible of type Unknown can hold value of any type, but you must 
perform type checks or type assertions before using them in specific ways
